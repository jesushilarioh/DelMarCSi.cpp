                                <p>I decided to create a repository that would feature bootstrap templates that I create. I aspire to be a awesome at what I do. Quite simply, because I love it. </p>
                                <p>Today I spent most of the day studying expressjs. There are only so many hours in a day and I also have other priorities to tend to.</p>
                                <p>I'm glad that I got a new
                                    job in IT. I have no expereince in IT. However, like I told the person interviewing me, I am a quick learner and pick up things fast.</p>
                                <p>I've recently
                                    gone back to College to obtain a second degree. My first degree is in Music. Which, I wish I had known before, that It would only get me so far.
                                </p>
                                <p>I love what I do know and would not have it any other way. :) I know in my heart that great things are ahead for me and my family--my wife, daughter and me.
                                    Thanks for stinking around thus far and actually reading this. Cheers to more good time and to have courage to rough it through the bad ones.
