## C++
Hey y'all, most of these examples come from my learning through Tony Gaddis, "Starting Out With C++", 8th Edition. Feel free to use!! Thanks

Here is an example of what you'll see... in these examples. 
```C++
//***********************************************
// This program calculates the user's pay.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    double hours, rate, pay;

    // Get the number of hours worked.
    cout << "How many hours did you work?";
    cin >> hours;

    // Get the hourly pay rate.
    cout << "How much do you get paid per hour?";
    cin >> rate;

    // Calculate the pay.
    pay = hours * rate;

    // Display the pay.
    cout << "You have earned $" << pay << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
