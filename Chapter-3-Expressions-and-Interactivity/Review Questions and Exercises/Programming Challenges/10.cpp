*	10. HOW MUCH INSURANCE?
*
*       Many financial experts advise that property owners should
*       insure their homes of buildings for at least 80 percent of
*       the amount it wyould cost to replace the structure. Write a
*       program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost
*       of a building and then displays the minimum amount of
*       insurance he or she should buy for the property.
