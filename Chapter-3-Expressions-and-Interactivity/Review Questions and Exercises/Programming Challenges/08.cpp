*	08. HOW MANY WIDGETS?
*
*       The Yukon Widget Company manufactures widgets that weigh 12.5
*       pounds each. Write a program that calculates how many widgets
*       are stacked on a pallet, based on the toal weight of the
*       pallet. The program should ask the user how much the pallet
*       weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it. It
*       should then calculate and display the number of widgets
*       stacked on the pallet.
