*	19. MONTHLY PAYMENTS
*
*       The monthly payment on a loan may be calculated by the
*       following formula:
*       Payment = [Rate * (1 + Rate)^N / ((1 + Rate)^N - 1)] * L
*
*       Rate is the monthly interest rate, which is the annual interest
*       rate divided by 12. (12% annual interest would be 1 percent
*       monthly interest.) N is the number of payments, and L is the
*       amount of the loan. Write a program that asks for these
*       values and displays a report similar to
*
*       Loan Amount:            $ 10000.00
*       Monthly Interest Rate:          1%
*       Number of Payments:             36
*       Monthly Payment:        $   332.14
*       Amount Paid Back:       $ 11957.15
*       Interest Paid:          $  1957.15
