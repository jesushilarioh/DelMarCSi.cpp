*	14. MONTHLY SALES TAX
*
*       A retail company must file a monthly sales tax
*       report listing the sales for the monthe and the
*       amount of sales tax collected. Write a program
*       that asks for the month, the year, and the total
*       amount collected at the cash register (that is, sales
*       plus sales tax). Assume the state sales tax is 4
*       percent and the county sales tax is 2 percent.
*
*       If the total amount collected is known and the total
*       sales tax is 6 percent, the amount of
*       product sales may be calculated as:
*
*       S = T / 1.06
*
*       S is the product sales and T is the total income
*       (product sales plus sales tax).
*
*       The program should display a report similar to
*
*       Month: October
*       --------------------
*       Total Collected:    $  26572.89
*       Sales:              $  25068.76
*       County Sales Tax:   $    501.38
*       State Sales Tax:    $   1002.75
*       Total Sales Tax:    $   1504.13
