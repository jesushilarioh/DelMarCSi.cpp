*	18. Interest Earned
*
*       Assuming there are no deposits other than the original
*       investment, the balance in a savings account after one
*       year may be calculated as
*
*       Amount = Principal * (1 + Rate/T)^T
*
*       Principal is the balance in the savings account, Rate is
*       the interest rate, and T is the number of times the interest
*       is compounded during a year (T is 4 if the interest is
*       compounded quarterly).
*
*       Write a program that asks for the principal,
*       the interest rate, and the number of times the interest
*       is compounded. It should display a report similar
*       to
*
*       Interest Rate:                4.25%
*       Times Compounded:               12
*       Principal:              $  1000.00
*       Interest:               $    43.34
*       Amount in Savings:      $  1043.34
