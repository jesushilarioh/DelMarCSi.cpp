*	02. STADIUM SEATING
*
*       There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a
*       softball game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12,
*       and Class C seats cost $9. Write a program that ask how many
*       tickets for each class of seats were sold, then displays the
*       amount of income generated from ticket sales. Format your dollar
*       amount in fixed-point notation, with two decimal places of
*       precision, and be sure the decimal point is always displayed.
