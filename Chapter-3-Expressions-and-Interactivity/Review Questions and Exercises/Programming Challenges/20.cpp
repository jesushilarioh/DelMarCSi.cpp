*	20. PIZZA PIE
*
*       Joe’s Pizza Palace needs a program to calculate the number of
*       slices a pizza of any size can be divided into. The program
*       should perform the following steps:
*
*       A) Ask the user for the diameter of the pizza in inches.
*       B) Calculate the number of slices that may be taken from a
*          pizza of that size.
*       C) Display a message telling the number of slices.
*
*       To calculate the number of slices that may be taken from the
*       pizza, you must know the following facts:
*
*       • Each slice should have an area of 14.125 inches.
*       • To calculate the number of slices, simply divide the
*         area of the pizza by 14.125.
*       • The area of the pizza is calculated with this formula:
*
*       Area = πr^2
*
*       NOTE: π is the Greek letter pi. 3.14159 can be used as its value.
*       The variable r is the radius of the pizza. Divide the diameter
*       by 2 to get the radius.
*
*       Make sure the output of the program displays the number of
*       slices in fixed point nota- tion, rounded to one decimal
*       place of precision. Use a named constant for pi.
