*	17. MATH TUTOR
*
*       Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a
*       young student. The program should display two random numbers
*       to be added, such as
*
*       247 + 129 = ?
*
*       The program should then pause while the student works on the
*       problem. When the student is ready to check the answer,
*       he or she can press a key and the program will display the
*       correct solution:
*
*       247 + 129 = 376
