*	05. MALE AND FEMALE PERCENTAGES
*
*       Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and
*       the number of females registered in a class. The program
*       should display the percentage of males and females in the class.
*
*       Hint: Suppose there are 8 males and 12 females in a class.
*       There are 20 students in the class. The percentage of males
*       can be calculated as 8 / 20 = 0.4, or 40%. The percentage
*       of females can be calculated as 12 / 20 = 0.06, or 60%.
