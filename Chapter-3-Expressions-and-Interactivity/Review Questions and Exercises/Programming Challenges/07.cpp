*	07. BOX OFFICE
*
*       A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned
*       from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie distributor.
*       Write a program that calculates a theater's gross and net box
*       office profit for a night. The program should ask for the name
*       of the movie, and how many adult and child tickets were sold.
*       (The price of an adult ticket is $10.00 and a child's ticket
*       is $6.00.) It should display a report similar to
*
*       Movie Name:                 "Wheels of Fury"
*       Adult Tickets Sold:         382
*       Child Tickets Sold:         127
*       Gross Box Office Profit:    $4582.00
*
*       (NOTE: Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of the gross box
*           office profit.)
