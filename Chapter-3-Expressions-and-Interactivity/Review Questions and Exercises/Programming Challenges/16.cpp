*	16. SENIOR CITIZEN PROPERTY TAX
*
*       Madison County provides a $5,000 homeowner exemption for its
*       senior citizens. For example, if a senior's house is
*       valued at $158,000 its assessed value would be $94,800,
*       as explained above. However, he would only pay tax on
*       $89,800. At last year's tax rate of $2.64 for each $100 of
*       assessed value, the property tax would be $2,370.72. In
*       addition to the tax break, senior citizens are allowed to
*       pay their property tax in four equal payments. The quarterly
*       payment due on this property would be $592.68. Write a
*       program that asks the user tin input the actual value
*       of a piece of property and the current tax rate for
*       each $100 of assess value. The program should then
*       calculate and report how much annual property tax a
*       senior homeowner will be charged for this property
*       and what the quarterly tax bill will be.
