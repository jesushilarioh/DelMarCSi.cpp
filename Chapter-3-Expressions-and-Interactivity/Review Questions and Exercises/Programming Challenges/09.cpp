*	09. HOW MANY CALORIES?
*
*       A bag of cookies holds 30 cookies. The calorie information on
*       the bag claims that there are 10 "servings" in the bag and
*       that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program that
*       asks the user to input how many cookies he or she
*       actually ate and then reports how many total calories
*       were consumed.
