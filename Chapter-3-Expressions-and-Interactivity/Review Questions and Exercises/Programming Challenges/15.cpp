*	15. PROPERTY TAX
*
*       A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of
*       property, which is 60 percent of the property's
*       actual value. If an acre of land is valued at
*       $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The
*       property tax is then 75Â¢ for each $100 of the assessment
*       value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be
*       $45. Write a program that asks for the actual value of a
*       piece of property and displays the assessment value and property 
*       tax.
