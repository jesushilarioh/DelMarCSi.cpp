    FALSE



50. The while loop is a pretest loop.

    TRUE



51. The do-while loop is a pretest loop.

    FALSE



52. The for loop is a posttest loop.

    FALSE



53. It is not necessary to initialize counter variables.

    FALSE



54. All three of the for loop’s expressions may be omitted.

    TRUE



55. One limitation of the for loop is that only one variable may be initialized in

    FALSE



56. Variables may be defined inside the body of a loop.

58. In a nested loop, the outer loop executes faster than the inner loop.

    FALSE




59. In a nested loop, the inner loop goes through all of its iterations for every
    single iteration of the outer loop.

    TRUE



60. To calculate the total number of iterations of a nested loop, add the number
    of iterations of all the loops.

    FALSE: multiply instead



61. The break statement causes a loop to stop the current iteration and begin
    the next one.

    FALSE: (break) statement causes the loop to terminate, while the program
           continue.



62. The continue statement causes a terminated loop to resume.

    FALSE: (continue) cause it's current iteration to cease, while continuing
