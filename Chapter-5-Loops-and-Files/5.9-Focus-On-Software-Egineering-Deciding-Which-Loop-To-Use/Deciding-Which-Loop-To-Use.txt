CONCEPT: Although most repetitive algorithms can be written with any of the
		 three types of loops, each works best in different situations.
		 
		The ideal to use in different situations:
		
		1. - The (while) loop. The (while) loop is a conditional loop, which means
		  it repeats as long as a particular condit exists. It is also a pretest
		  loop, so it is 
		  
		  IDEAL in situations where you do not want to loop to
		  iterate if the condition is false from the beginning.	
		  
		  For example, validating input that has been read and reading lists of
		  data terminated by a sentinel value are good applications of the
		  (while) loop.
		  
		  
		  
		2. - The (do-while) loop. The (do-while) loop is also a conditional loop.
		  (while) loop, however, (do-while) is a posttest loop. It is 
		  
		  IDEAL in situations where you always want the loop to iterate at least 
		  once. The (do-while) loop is a good choice for repeating a menu.
		  
		  
		  
		3. - The (for) loop. The (for) loop is a pretest loop that has built-in
		  expressions for initializing, testing, and updating. These expressions
		  make it very convenient to use counter variable to control the number
		  of iterations that the loop performs. The initialization expression
		  can initialize the counter variable to a starting value, the test
		  expression can test the counter variable to determine whether it holds
		  the maximum value, and the update expression can increment the counter
		  variable. The (for) loop is 
		  
		  IDEAL in situations where the exact number
		  of iterations is known.
