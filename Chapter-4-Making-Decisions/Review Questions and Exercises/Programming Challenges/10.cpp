*	10. Days in a Month
*
*       Write a program that asks the user to enter the month
*       (letting the user enter an integer in the range of 1
*       through 12) and the year. The program should then display
*       the number of days in that month. Use the following criteria to
*       identify leap years:
*
*           1. Determine whether the year is divisible by 100.
*               If it is, then it is a leap year if and only
*               if it is divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a
*               leap year but 2100 is not.
*
*           2. If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a
*               leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For
*               example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
*
*           Here is a sample run of the program:
*           Enter a month (1-12): 2 [Enter]
*           Enter a year: 2008 [Enter]
*           29 days
