*	15. Shipping Charges
*
*       The Fast Freight Shipping Company charges the following rates:
*       _______________________________________________________________
*        Weight of Package (in Kilograms)   Rate per 500 Miles Shipped
*       ---------------------------------------------------------------
*        2 Kg or less                           $1.10
*        Over 2 kg but not more than 6kg        $2.20
*        Over 6 kg but not more than 10 kg      $3.70
*        Over 10 kg but not more than 20 kg     $4.80
*       ---------------------------------------------------------------
*
*       Write a program that asks for the weight of the package and the
*       distance it is to be shipped, and then displays the charges.
*
*       Input Validation: Do not accept values of 0 or less for the
*       weight of the package. Do not accept weights of more than 20
*       kg (this is the maximum weight the company will ship). Do not
*       accept distances of less than 10 miles or more than 3,000 miles.
*       These are the companyâ€™s minimum and maximum shipping distances.
