*	05. Body Mass Index
*
*       Write a program that calculates and displays a person’s body
*       mass index (BMI). The BMI is often used to determine whether
*       a person with a sedentary lifestyle is over- weight or
*       underweight for his or her height. A person’s BMI is
*       calculated with the following formula:
*
*       BMI = weight x 703 / height^2
*
*       where weight is measured in pounds and height is measured
*       in inches. The program should display a message indicating
*       whether the person has optimal weight, is under- weight,
*       or is overweight. A sedentary person’s weight is considered to be
*       optimal if his or her BMI is between 18.5 and 25. If the BMI is
*       less than 18.5, the person is consid- ered to be underweight.
*       If the BMI value is greater than 25, the person is considered to be
*       overweight.
