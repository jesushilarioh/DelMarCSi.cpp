*	25. Mobile Service Provider
*
*       A mobile phone service provider has three different
*       subscription packages for its customers:
*
*       Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided.
*                  Additional minutes are $0.45 per minute.
*       Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided.
*                  Additional minutes are $0.40 per minute.
*       Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
*
*       Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill.
*       It should ask which package the customer has purchased and how
*       many minutes were used. It should then display the total amount
*       due.
*
*       Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or
*       C.
