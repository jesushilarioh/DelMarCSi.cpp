/********************************************************************
*
*	11. Math Tutor
*
*       This is a modification of Programming Challenge 17 from Chapter 3.
*       Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student.
*       The program should display two random numbers that are to be added,
*       such as:
*                   247
*                  +129
*                 -----
*
*       The program should wait for the student to enter the answer. If
*       the answer is correct, a message of congratulations should be
*       printed. If the answer is incorrect, a message should be printed
*       showing the correct answer.
