// Lab # 5 Ch 3 Programming Challenge #10
//  Celsius to Fahrenheit extended
// Due Date: October 5, 2016
// Instructor: Korinne Caruso
//
// Purpose: This program converts Celsius to Fahrenheit or
// Fahrenheit to Celsius.
//
// Input: Some input will be expressed in a do while loop,
// while Celsius or Fahrenheit input will be processed and
// calculated to convert Celius to Fahrenheit and
// Farenheit to Celsius.
//
// Output: The user will asked their name. There name will
// be displayed back to them. They will also have a menu
// to choose from. A quit the program option will be
// available to the user through a while loop.
